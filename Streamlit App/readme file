## 📝 Required CSV Format

Your CSV must contain at least the following columns:

| Column      | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Date`      | Sale date (e.g. 2024-01-15)          |
| `Brand`     | Car brand (e.g. Toyota, Ford)        |
| `Model`     | Car model (e.g. Camry, Civic)        |
| `Price`     | Sale price (numeric)                 |

**Optional columns (for map visualization):**

- `Latitude` or similar (`lat`, `latitudes`)
- `Longitude` or similar (`lng`, `lon`, `long`)

The app will automatically detect and rename these if found.
